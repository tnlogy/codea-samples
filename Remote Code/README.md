Remote Code
=============

This is an example of using Codea with an Express server to be able to write code on your computer that will automatically be updated on your iPad.

Use iExplorer or a similar application to move the Codea application "Remote Code.codea" to your iPad and change the url to the ip address of your computer.

Start the server with "node app.js" and start the Codea application.
