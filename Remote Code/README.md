Remote Code
=============

This is an example of using Codea with an Express server to be able to write code on your computer that will automatically be updated on your iPad.

How to install
==============

Use iExplorer or a similar application to move the Codea application "Remote Code.codea" to your iPad and change the url to the ip address of your computer.

Install nodejs and run "npm install" in the directory "Remote Code".

Start the server with "node app.js" and then start the Codea application.

The code that will be sent to the server is in the directory luaCode.
